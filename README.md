# Capstone Project: Cyclistic Case Study
## Introduction:
To complete the Google Data Analytics Specialization and earn my Professionial Certificate, I have completed a Capstone Project highlighting the technical skills (SQL, Tableau, R) I learned during the course. The case I chose to analyze for my Capstone Project is the 'Cyclistic Case Study'.
## Background:
- Cyclistic is a fictional bike-share company based in Chicago which offers over 6000 bikes at 800+ docking stations spread around Chicago. At the moment they offer bikes for use to two customer segments: Casuals and Members.
- The marketing department has been tasked with creating a campaign aimed at converting Casuals to Annual Members. To help them complete this business task, the marketing team has assigned me with answering the following question **"How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?"**
